# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This work day scheduler is designed to be a helpful tool that allows users to keep track of the tasks and events in their working day. The scheduler displays the current date at the top of the page, and then lists time blocks from 9am - 5pm that are colour coded to show past hours in grey, the present hour in red, and the future in green.

This application uses Bootstrap CSS, JQuery and Moment.js.
